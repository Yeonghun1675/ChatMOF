PLAN_PROMPT = """Create a plan to generate material based on the following question. 
Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must to answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Property: the property you can predict, must be one of [{model_names}]
Objective: you should decide what criteria you wan to generate by.
Search look-up table: plan to extract 100 material for the purpose from the look-up table where the property is pre-calculated.
Genetic algorithm: plan to create a new materials using the 100 extracted mateirals.
Final thought: get a final answer based on the structures you generate.

Begin!
Question: generate a material with a porosity of 0.5 and surface area of 120 m2/g
Thought: I need to generate a material with a porosity value of 0.5 and surface area of 120 m2/g. 
Property: void_fraction, accessible_surface_area
Objective: near 0.5, near 120
Search look-up table: extract cif_id, void_fraction, and accessible_surface_area of 100 materials with porosity close to 0.5 and surface area near 120 m2/g from look-up tables. 
Genetic algorithm: create a new material with a porosity close to 0.5 and surface area near 120 m2/g from 100 materials
Final Thought: Based on the generated CIF, find the material that is closest to a porosity of 0.5 and a surface area of 120 m2/g.

Question: generate a material with a highest band-gap
Thought: I need to generate a material with a highest band-gap.
Property: bandgap
Objective: max
Search look-up table: extract cif_id and bandgap of 100 materials with high band-gap value from look-up tables. 
Genetic algorithm: generate 100 new materials with the highest band gap from the 100 materials.
Final Thought: Based on the generated CIF, find the material that has highest band-gap.
