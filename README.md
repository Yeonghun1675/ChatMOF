# ChatMOF : An Autonomous AI System for Predicting and Generating Metal-Organic Frameworks

ChatMOF is an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that is built to predict and generate of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By leveraging a large-scale language model (gpt-3.5-turbo), ChatMOF extracts key details from textual inputs and delivers appropriate responses, thus eliminating the necessity for rigid structured queries. The system is comprised of  three core components (i.e. an agent, a toolkit, and an evaluator) and it forms a robust pipeline that manages a variety of tasks, including data retrieval, property prediction, and structure generation. The study further explores the merits and constraints of using large language models (LLMs) AI system in material sciences using and showcases its transformative potential for future advancements.

Note : Currently, the code is in beta version and needs to be cleaned up for release.

## Install

### Dependencies

NOTE: This package is primarily tested on Linux. We strongly recommend using Linux for the installation.

```
python>=3.9
```

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Yeonghun1675/ChatMOF.git
$ cd ChatMOF/
$ pip install -e .
```

For MOF generation, you need to install MOFTransformer's GRIDAY.

```bash
$ moftransformer install-griday
```

## Architecture

ChatMOF comprises three core components: an agent, toolkits, and an evaluator. Upon receiving a query from human, the agent formulates a plan and selects a suitable toolkit. Subsequently, the toolkit generates outputs following the proposed plan, and the evaluator makes these results into a final response.
