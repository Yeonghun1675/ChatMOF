[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with a density less than 0.8, we can use the pandas function df[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] < 0.8]. Then, to find the one with the largest cavity diameter, we can use the function idxmax() on the 'Largest cavity diameter (Å)' column.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json
low_density_materials = df[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] < 0.8]
material_with_largest_cavity = low_density_materials['Largest cavity diameter (Å)'].idxmax()
print(df.loc[material_with_largest_cavity].to_markdown())[0m
