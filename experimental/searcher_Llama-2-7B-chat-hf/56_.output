[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with the largest density.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the `loc` method to select the rows of the DataFrame that correspond to the materials with the largest density.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.loc[df['Density'] > 3000, ['name', 'Density']].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Density'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe error is because the column name is not 'Density' but 'Largest cavity diameter (Å)'. We must change the column name to 'Density' in the `loc` method.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the densities of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
